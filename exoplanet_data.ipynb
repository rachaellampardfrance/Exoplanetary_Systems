    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The ['Pie Chart: Systems Where Exoplanets Most Commonly Occur'](#pie_sys_exoplanet_occurance) shows that exoplanet systems are much more likely to occur within systems that contain only 1 star, as 91.02% of confirmed exoplanet systems are found in systems only containing one star, 7.86% occuring in a 2 star system, 1.07% in a 3 star system and as little as 0.5% occuring in a 4 star system. This shows us that exoplanet systems are much less likely to present in binary star systems, than solitary star systems, and additional stars in a binary system further reduces the chance of exoplanets occuring. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ['Grouped Bar Chart: Exoplanet Systems by Star Count'](#bar_exosys_by_star) shows a visual 'scale' and 'log' representation of observations of exoplanet systems within star systems of varying star count. The 'scale' bar chart shows clearly that exoplanetary systems containing only 1 planet are much more common than multiplanetary systems, and a steady decrease in multiplanetary systems occuring as planet count increases from 2-8 planets. The 'log' bar chart helps visualise rare occurances such as the 7, and 8 multiplanetary systems occuring in a 1 star system and many of the systems occuring in binary star systems as they occur much less frequently than planetary systems in a 1 star system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ['Pie Figure: Most Common Exoplanet Systems'](#most_common_exoplanet_systems) shows another representaion of the data from the 'Grouped Bar Chart: Exoplanet Systems by Star Count' where the frequency of planetary systems are comapared against other planetary systems occuring within a system by it's star count. Any exoplanet system falling below the 1% margin is left out of the data as to not crowd the data, as we know 7 and 8 planet systems have been found within a 1 star system, however in comparision to the 3032 counts of 1 planet systems in a 1 star system these singular 7 and 8 systems would be miniscule. But from this data we can see that in 1-3 star systems, the likely hood of an esisting exoplanet system containing just 1 star is typically between 78% - 80%, and the next most common being a 2 planet system, though when it comes to a 3 star system 3 planet systems do not present, however 5-6 planet systems in a 3 star system maybe just as common as a 3 planet system occuring in a 1-2 star system. However 4 star systems show as an outlier as only 1 planet systems are likely to occur, although we know from the other data sets that there have only been 2 confirmed planetary systems in a 4 star system, opposed to the 3,914 planetary systems observed in a 1 star system.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Single planetary systems are much more likely to occur than multiplanetary systems and planetary systems are much less likely to occur in binary systems than single star systems. The commonality of multiplanetary systems reduces by increas in planet count.\n",
